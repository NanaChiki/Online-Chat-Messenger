🔧 SERVER SHUTDOWN/RESTART FIX - COMPREHENSIVE TEST

📋 STEP-BY-STEP TESTING:

1️⃣  Start the server:
   ```
   python3 stage1/server.py
   ```
   ✅ Should see: "🚀 Chat Server started on localhost:12345"

2️⃣  Start Client 1 (Alice):
   ```
   python3 stage1/client.py
   Username: Alice
   🗣️ join
   ```
   ✅ Should see: "📡 Join request sent! You can now send messages."

3️⃣  Start Client 2 (Bob):
   ```
   python3 stage1/client.py
   Username: Bob
   🗣️ join
   ```
   ✅ Alice should see: "🔔 🎉 Bob has joined the chat"
   ✅ Bob should see: "🔔 🎉 Alice has joined the chat"

4️⃣  Test normal chat:
   Alice types: "Hello Bob!"
   ✅ Bob should see: "💬 [Alice]: Hello Bob!"

5️⃣  **CRITICAL TEST** - Server shutdown:
   In server terminal, press Ctrl+C
   
   Expected results:
   ✅ Server shows: "📢 Notified 2 clients about shutdown"
   ✅ Alice immediately sees: "🔔 🛑 Server is shutting down. Please wait until it comes back."
   ✅ Bob immediately sees: "🔔 🛑 Server is shutting down. Please wait until it comes back."
   ✅ After a moment, clients show: "🔌 Connection lost. Trying to reconnect..."

6️⃣  **CRITICAL TEST** - Client reconnection:
   Wait 5-10 seconds with server off
   ✅ Clients should show: "⏳ Still trying to reconnect... (attempt N)"

7️⃣  **CRITICAL TEST** - Server restart:
   Restart the server: `python3 stage1/server.py`
   
   Expected results within 5 seconds:
   ✅ Server shows: "🏓 Ping from Alice at ... - responded with pong"
   ✅ Server shows: "🏓 Ping from Bob at ... - responded with pong"
   ✅ Alice sees: "✅ Connection restored! Please type 'join' to re-enter chat."
   ✅ Bob sees: "✅ Connection restored! Please type 'join' to re-enter chat."

8️⃣  **FINAL TEST** - Rejoin and chat:
   Both clients type: "join"
   ✅ Should see join notifications again
   
   Test chat again:
   Alice types: "We're back!"
   ✅ Bob should see: "💬 [Alice]: We're back!"

📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA:

✅ **Immediate shutdown notification** (not after timeout)
✅ **Automatic reconnection attempts** every 5 seconds
✅ **Successful reconnection detection** via ping/pong
✅ **No phantom users** after reconnection
✅ **Full functionality restored** after rejoin

🔧 KEY FIXES APPLIED:

1. **Server Shutdown Timing Fix:**
   - Added 0.5 second delay before closing socket
   - Ensures shutdown messages are sent before socket closes

2. **Client Reconnection Logic Fix:**
   - Uses ping/pong mechanism instead of unreliable heartbeat
   - Creates fresh socket for each reconnection attempt
   - Proper timeout handling (3 seconds per attempt)

3. **Server Ping Response:**
   - New MSG_TYPE_PING and encode_ping_request()
   - Server responds with "pong" to ping requests
   - Allows reliable connection testing

4. **Robust Error Handling:**
   - Graceful socket closure and recreation
   - Progress messages every 30 seconds
   - No infinite error loops

🎯 BEFORE vs AFTER:

❌ **BEFORE (Buggy):**
   - No shutdown notifications sent
   - Unreliable reconnection detection
   - Long delays or no reconnection
   - Poor user experience

✅ **AFTER (Fixed):**
   - Immediate shutdown notifications
   - Reliable ping/pong reconnection
   - Fast reconnection (< 5 seconds)
   - Professional user experience
