🐛➡️✅ EMPTY INPUT LINE FIX EXPLANATION

🔍 THE PROBLEM:
After server reconnection, an empty input line appears. Here's why:

1️⃣  Main Thread Flow:
   ```python
   while self.running:
       message = input()  # ← BLOCKED waiting for user input
       # Process message...
   ```

2️⃣  Receive Thread Flow:
   ```python
   def _handle_connection_lost(self):
       # ... reconnection logic
       print("✅ Connection restored!")  # ← Prints from different thread
       # But main thread still blocked in input()!
   ```

3️⃣  User Experience:
   - User sees: 🗣️ [cursor waiting]
   - Connection lost/restored messages appear
   - User must press Enter to complete interrupted input()
   - Main thread gets empty string "" → processes as empty input
   - Results in confusing empty line

🔧 THE SOLUTION:

1️⃣  Clear Communication:
   ✅ "Press Enter to continue..." - tells user what to do
   ✅ Clear explanation of reconnection status

2️⃣  Graceful Empty Input Handling:
   ```python
   elif self.just_reconnected:
       # Handle empty input after reconnection gracefully
       self.just_reconnected = False
       # Just continue to show prompt again
   ```

3️⃣  State Management:
   ✅ Track reconnection state with `just_reconnected` flag
   ✅ Reset flag after handling first empty input
   ✅ No error messages for expected empty input

📊 BEFORE vs AFTER:

❌ BEFORE (Confusing):
🗣️ [user typing]
🔌 Connection lost. Trying to reconnect...
✅ Connection restored! Please type 'join' to re-enter chat.
🗣️ [user presses Enter - gets empty line processed]
🗣️ [new prompt - user confused]

✅ AFTER (Clear):
🗣️ [user typing]
🔌 Connection lost. Trying to reconnect...
✅ Connection restored! Please type 'join' to re-enter chat.
💡 Press Enter to continue...
🗣️ [user presses Enter - handled gracefully]
🗣️ [clean prompt ready for 'join']

🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Clear User Instructions**: "Press Enter to continue..."
2. **Graceful Empty Input**: No error processing for expected empty input
3. **State Tracking**: `just_reconnected` flag prevents confusion
4. **Professional UX**: Users understand what's happening

🧪 MANUAL TEST:

1. Start server: `python3 stage1/server.py`
2. Start client: `python3 stage1/client.py`
3. Type: join
4. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
5. Restart server
6. Observe clean reconnection experience!

✨ RESULT: No more confusing empty input lines! 🎉
