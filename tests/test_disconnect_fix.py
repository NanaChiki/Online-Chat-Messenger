🔧 DISCONNECT NOTIFICATION FIX - MANUAL TEST

📋 TESTING THE FIX:

1️⃣  Start server: `python stage1/server.py`

2️⃣  Start Client 1 (Alice):
   ```
   python stage1/client.py
   Username: Alice
   🗣️ join
   🗣️ Hello everyone!
   ```

3️⃣  Start Client 2 (Bob):
   ```
   python stage1/client.py  
   Username: Bob
   🗣️ join
   🗣️ Hi Alice!
   ```

4️⃣  Now test IMMEDIATE disconnect notifications:

   🔹 OPTION A - Type 'quit' in Alice's terminal:
      Expected results:
      ✅ Alice sees: "📤 Disconnect notification sent to server"
      ✅ Bob immediately sees: "🔔 👋 Alice has left the chat"
      ✅ Server immediately shows: "🚪 Alice disconnected from ... (explicit disconnect)"

   🔹 OPTION B - Press Ctrl+C in Alice's terminal:
      Expected results:
      ✅ Alice sees: "📤 Disconnect notification sent to server"  
      ✅ Bob immediately sees: "🔔 👋 Alice has left the chat"
      ✅ Server immediately shows: "🚪 Alice disconnected from ... (explicit disconnect)"

📊 BEFORE vs AFTER:

❌ BEFORE (Buggy behavior):
   - Disconnect only detected after 60-second timeout
   - No immediate notification to other users
   - Poor user experience

✅ AFTER (Fixed behavior):
   - Immediate disconnect detection
   - Instant notification to other users  
   - Professional chat experience

🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
   1. Added MSG_TYPE_DISCONNECT to protocol
   2. Client sends explicit disconnect message on quit/Ctrl+C
   3. Server immediately processes disconnect and notifies others
   4. No more waiting for timeout detection
